*Make your code **NOT** suck!*

I love the idea of automated code reviews!  It makes the development process much faster and allows the engineer to focus more on the business logic.  Which is where his attention should be focused.  Of the few automated code reviews tools I've used my favorite is [Code Climate](http://codeclimate.com).  There is only one problem I have with Code Climate and that is it's pricing structure.  It is definitely going after the development team or enterprise team audience.  While I am waiting for them to get back to me about student and non-profit plans I have been using PHP Code Sniffer (*phpcs*) with *php-cs-fixer*

The grading scale and code coverage integration along with the ticket integration are the features that I used consistently.  These things can be done other ways but Code Climate makes it so much easier.

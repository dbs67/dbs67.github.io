*Building a PHAR for a PHP project!*

Some in the PHP community have said the PHP developers have too much Java envy.  I am not exactly sure what they mean. As long as PHP adopts good practices from Java development I am all for it!  One of the practices that  I am glad that is now in PHP is the single PHAR archive for PHP applications.
